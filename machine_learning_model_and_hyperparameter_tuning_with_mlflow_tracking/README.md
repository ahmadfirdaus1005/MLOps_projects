# üè° House Price Prediction with MLflow Tracking

This project builds a **house price prediction model** using the California Housing dataset and tracks experiments using **MLflow**. The model is trained using a **Random Forest Regressor**, and hyperparameter tuning is performed using **GridSearchCV**. All relevant metrics, parameters, and models are logged via MLflow.
